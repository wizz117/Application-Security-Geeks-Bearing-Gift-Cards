This repository contains my completed solution for Homework 1 of NYU's Application Security course. The assignment involved auditing, testing, fuzzing, and patching a vulnerable C-based gift card reader program provided by "Shoddycorp's Cut-Rate Contracting".

---

## ✅ Part 1: Environment Setup

- Configured Git with signed commits using GPG.
- GitHub Actions set up with a custom CI workflow located at `.github/workflows/hello.yml`.
- Verified CI pipeline was triggered correctly on commit.

---

## ✅ Part 2: Auditing and Test Cases

- **Audited the original C source code** (`giftcardreader.c`) and discovered multiple vulnerabilities.
- Developed and added the following test cases:
  - `crash1.gft`: Triggers a segmentation fault via invalid type parsing.
  - `crash2.gft`: Exploits an out-of-bounds memory access.
  - `hang.gft`: Triggers an infinite loop via malformed animation instructions.
- Fixed the bugs that triggered these crashes/hangs.
- Created regression tests and verified fixes using GitHub Actions.
- Documented the bugs in [`part2.txt`](./part2.txt).

---

## ✅ Part 3: Fuzzing & Code Coverage

- Measured initial coverage using `gcov` and `lcov`.
- Created additional test cases:
  - `cov1.gft` and `cov2.gft`: Reach previously untested code paths.
- Used **AFL++** to fuzz the program for 2+ hours.
- Discovered and patched additional crashes:
  - `fuzzer1.gft` and `fuzzer2.gft`
- Verified all fixes with GitHub Actions and regression tests.
- Provided full details in [`part3.txt`](./part3.txt).

## Introduction

You've been handed the unpleasant task of performing an audit of code
written by your company's least-favorite contractor, Shoddycorp's
Cut-Rate Contracting. The program is designed to read in gift card files
in a legacy binary file format, and then display them in either a simple
text output format, or in JSON format. Unfortunately, Shoddycorp isn't
returning your calls, so you'll have to make do with the comments in the
file and your own testing.

Justin Cappos (JAC) and Brendan Dolan-Gavitt (BDG) have read through the
code already. It's a mess. We've tried to annotate a few places that
look suspicious, but there's no doubt that there are many bugs lurking
in this code. Make no mistake, this is *not* an example of C code that
you want to imitate.

## Part 1: Setting up Your Environment

In order to complete this assignment, you are required to use the git
VCS. Before beginning to write your code, you should first install git
and clone the repository from GitHub Classroom. The git binaries can
be installed by your local package manager or [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
For a cheat-sheet of git commands, please see [this](https://github.com/nyutandononline/CLI-Cheat-Sheet/blob/master/git-commands.md).
We will be spot checking your commit messages and/or git log, it is
recommended that you write descriptive commit messages so that the
evolution of your repository is easy to understand. For a guide to
writing good commit messages, please read [this](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
and the [Linux kernel's advice on writing good commit messages](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/tree/Documentation/SubmittingPatches?id=b23dac905bde28da47543484320db16312c87551#n134).

After git is installed, you will want to configure your git user to sign
your commits. This can be done by following all the steps to [verify commit signatures](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification). You will also
need to [add your GPG public key to your GitHub profile](https://github.com/settings/keys),
and make sure that the email address set in your GitHub account matches
the one you specified when generating your keys. You can find more information
about this in [GitHub's documentation on commit signature verification](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification). To avoid having to
type in your password all the time, you may also want to [set up SSH key
access to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh).

After accepting the invitation on GitHub Classroom, you can clone the
assignment repository by clicking the green "Code" button, copying the
repository URL under "Clone", and then running:

```
git clone <your_repository_url>
```

Note that if you have set up an SSH key, you will want to make sure you
copy the SSH URL (which looks like `git@github.com:NYUAppSec/...`). Also, we love that you setup an SSH key, good thinking!

The next step is to set up GitHub Actions to automatically build and test your code whenever you push a commit. You can find a [tutorial on GitHub Actions here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions). You are welcome to use this C/C++ GitHub Actions CI template [here](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/ci/c-cpp.yml).

For now, you should set up GitHub Actions to just run

```
echo "Hello world"
```

Whenever a new commit is pushed to the repository, GitHub Actions will run.
To do this, you'l create a file named `.github/workflows/hello.yml`.
Check that the Action is running correctly in the GitHub interface.

### Submission
If you’d like to submit this part, push the `hw1p1handin` tag with the following:

    git tag -a -m "Completed hw1 part1." hw1p1handin
    git push origin main
    git push origin hw1p1handin

## Part 2: Auditing and Test Cases

Read through the `giftcardreader.c` program (and its accompanying
header, `giftcard.h`) to get a feel for it. You should also try building
and running it with the included `examplefile.gft` file, to see what its
normal output is. You may find it helpful to use a debugger like `gdb`
or `lldb` to step through the program as it executes.

There is also a `Makefile` included in the repository. You can use this
to build the program by typing `make`. You will have three executables

* giftcardreader.original - This is the giftcard reader without any modifications
* giftcardreader.asan -  This executable has a compiler flag `-fsanitize=address` that tells the compiler to use the AddressSanitizer, a memory error detector.
* giftcardreader.ubsan - This has a compiler flag `-fsanitize=undefined` that tells the compiler to use the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, a fast undefined behavior detector. It helps detect undefined behavior issues like integer overflows, misaligned or null pointers, etc.

You can also use the `Makefile` to run the
(very minimal and incomplete) test suite (to which you will be adding more tests!) for the program by typing
`make test`, which uses `runtests.sh` to run the gift card reader on the
gift cards found in `testcases/valid` and `testcases/invalid`:

```
$ make test
$ ./runtests.sh
Running tests on valid gift cards (expected return value: 0)...
Testcase                                           Pass? Exit Status
animated.gft                                       PASS  0
examplefile.gft                                    PASS  0
message.gft                                        PASS  0

Running tests on invalid gift cards (expected return value: nonzero)...
Testcase                                           Pass? Exit Status
badtype.gft                                        PASS  1

TESTING SUMMARY:
Passed: 4
Failed: 0
Total:  4
```

For this part, your job will be to find some flaws in the program, and
then create test cases (i.e., binary gift cards) that expose flaws in
the program. You should write:

1. *Two* test cases, `crash1.gft` and `crash2.gft`, that cause the
   program to crash; each crash should have a different root cause. Make sure you understand the causes for your write-up. 
   If your input gift card can crash with ANY of the three executables you get credit for crashing the giftcardreader. 
   To get credit for remediation, you must at a MINIMUM ensure that the input gift card file 
   will NOT crash with BOTH `giftcardreader.asan` AND `giftcardreader.ubsan`. 
   To check if a program crashed, you will see a Segmentation fault. This can be verified checking 
   the exit code of a program using `$?` on the terminal after your giftcardreader has finished executing.

2. One test case, `hang.gft`, that causes the program to loop
   infinitely. (Hint: you may want to examine the "animation" record type
   to find a bug that causes the program to loop infinitely.)

3. A text file, `part2.txt` explaining the bug triggered by each of your
   three test cases.

To create your own test files, you may want to refer to the `gengift.py`
and `genanim.py` programs, which are Python scripts that create gift
card files of different types.

Finally, fix the bugs that are triggered by your test cases, and verify
that the program no longer crashes / hangs on your test cases. To make
sure that these bugs don't come up again as the code evolves, have
GitHub Actions automatically build and run the program in your test suite.
You can do this by placing the new test cases in the `testcases/valid` or
`testcases/invalid` directories (depending on whether the gift card reader
should accept or reject them). Then have GitHub Actions run `make test`. Note
that you do *not* need to run your tests on the unfixed version of the
code---the tests are intended to verify that the code is fixed and prevent
the bugs from being reintroduced in later versions (known as *regression
tests*). You are showing that your fixes work, which means running your newly built code. 

### Submission
If you’d like to submit this part, push the `hw1p2handin` tag with the following:

    git tag -a -m "Completed hw1 part2." hw1p2handin
    git push origin main
    git push origin hw1p2handin

## Part 3: Fuzzing and Coverage

As discussed in class, an important part of understanding how well your
test suite exercises your program's behaviors is *coverage*. To start
off, measure the coverage that your program achieves with the test cases
you created in Part 2. To do this, you should build `giftcardreader`
with the `--coverage` option to `gcc`, run your test suite, and then
produce a coverage report using `lcov` (Hints on how to do this can be
found on Brightspace).

You should notice that there are portions of the program that are
*uncovered* (i.e., the code was not executed while processing your test
suite). Pick two lines of code from the program that are currently
not covered and create test cases (`cov1.gft` and `cov2.gft`) that cover
them. You should add these test cases to your test suite by placing them
in the `testcases/valid` or `testcases/invalid` directory, as appropriate.

An easy and effective way of finding crashes and getting higher coverage
in a program is to *fuzz* it with a fuzzer like AFL++. Fuzz the program
using AFL++, following the [quick-start
instructions](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus#quick-start-fuzzing-with-afl). 
Feel free to also check the new [install scripts](https://github.com/NYUAppSec/appsec-env-setup-script). 
To make the fuzzing more effective, you should provide AFL
with all the test files you have created in its input directory. Let
the fuzzer run for at least two hours, and then examine the test cases
(in the `queue` directory) and crashes/hangs (in the `crashes` and
`hangs` directories).

Run the gift card reader on the test cases in the `queue` directory. You
can do this with a for loop like this:

```bash
for f in output/queue/id*; do ./giftcardreader 1 "$f"; done
```

And then produce a new coverage report. You should see that the tests
generated by the fuzzer reach more parts of the gift card program.

Finally, pick two crashes/hangs and fix the bugs in the program that
cause them. You should include these test cases in the tests you run
in GitHub Actions (as `fuzzer1.gft` and `fuzzer2.gft`). 
**The same rules for getting credit for `crash1.gft` and `crash2.gft` also applies for 
your two new giftcards generated by the fuzzer.**

To complete the assignment, commit your updated code, your handmade
tests (`cov1.gft` and `cov2.gft`), the fuzzer-generated tests (`fuzzer1.gft`
and `fuzzer2.gft`), and a brief writeup explaining the bugs you found
and fixed in this part (`part3.txt`). You do not need to commit all the test
cases generated by the fuzzer or the coverage reports.

### Submission
If you’d like to submit this part, push the `hw1p3handin` tag with the following:

    git tag -a -m "Completed hw1 part3." hw1p3handin
    git push origin main
    git push origin hw1p3handin

## Hints

1. What counts as two different bugs? A general rule of thumb is that
   if you can fix one of them without fixing the other, then they will
   be counted as distinct bugs.
2. Some crashes may not occur consistently every time you run the program,
   or may not occur when you run the program in a different environment or
   with different compile flags. One way to make a crash more reproducible
   is to use Address Sanitizer (ASAN), which we will cover in class. The
   `Makefile` also includes a target that will build the gift card reader
   using ASAN, which you can invoke with `make asan`.
3. When fixing a crash, you should try to understand what the root cause is.
   You will probably find it helpful to look at the address sanitizer output,
   which will usually tell you exactly what line of the program is accessing
   invalid memory. You may also want to try using the `gdb` or `lldb` debuggers;
   guides and tutorials can be found online. Your IDE (if you use one) may also
   provide a built-in debugger.
4. The gift card reader does *not* need to attempt to parse or "fix" invalid gift
   card files; you can simply reject these by printing an error and exiting with
   a non-zero exit code (e.g., `exit(1)`).

## Fuzzing Tips

1. Fuzzers work best when provided with good initial seeds that reach various parts of the program. You can use the test cases you've created so far as seeds by copying the .gft files into the input directory of AFL++.
2. AFL++ runs the program without ASAN enabled, so it may not detect all crashes. So you may be able to find additional crashing inputs by running the program with ASAN enabled on the inputs in the `queue` directory. To do so, run `make asan`, and then use a for loop like:

   ```bash
   for f in output/queue/id*; do ./giftcardreader 1 "$f"; done
   ```
3. You will want to make sure that the fuzzer is able to execute a decent number of test cases per second (e.g., 1000+). If your fuzzer is running slower than that, here are some options:
   * If you're fuzzing inside a Docker container, make sure your input and output directories are inside the container, rather than on a mounted volume.
   * If your machine has multiple cores (as most modern machines do), you can run multiple instances of the fuzzer in parallel. Start the first one using the `-M` option, and then start the others with `-S`. For example:

     ```bash
     afl-fuzz -i input -o output -M fuzzer1 ./giftcardreader 1 @@
     # In another terminal:
     afl-fuzz -i input -o output -S fuzzer2 ./giftcardreader 1 @@
     # In another terminal:
     afl-fuzz -i input -o output -S fuzzer3 ./giftcardreader 1 @@
     # etc.
     ```

## What to Submit

To submit your code, please only submit a file called `git_link.txt` that contains the name of your repository to **Gradescope**.
For example, if your repo is located at 'h<span>ttps:</span>//github.com/NYUAppSec/appsec-homework-1-exampleaccount', you would submit a text file named `git_link.txt` with only line that reads with <ins><b>only</b></ins> the following:

    appsec-homework-1-exampleaccount

Remember that <b>Gradescope is not instant</b>. Especially if we have to look into past GitHub action runs. We have a timeout set for 10 minutes, almost all well running code will complete within 5 minutes. Wait for it to complete or timeout before trying to re-run. 

For ease of grading, we ask that you also submit copies of your writeups as part2.txt and part3.txt directly in Gradescope. Please ensure that these writeups are exact copies of the files from your repository, as we have implemented a check to verify the match. For further details on the writeup requirements, please refer to the grading rubric available in Brightspace under the "Assignment Guideline" section.

Your repository should contain:

* Part 1
  * Your `.github/workflows/hello.yml`
  * At least one signed commit
* Part 2
  * In `testcases/invalid`: `crash1.gft`, `crash2.gft`, and `hang.gft`.
  * A text file named `part2.txt` that contains the bug descriptions
    for each of the three test cases
  * A GitHub Actions YML that runs your tests
  * A commit with the fixed version of the code (if you like, this
    commit can also contain the files mentioned above)
* Part 3
  * In `testcases/valid`: include the files `cov1.gft`, `cov2.gft`, and
    in `testcases/invalid`: include the additional files `fuzzer1.gft`,
    and `fuzzer2.gft`
  * A text file named `part3.txt` that contains your writeup
  * An updated Actions YML that runs the new tests
  * A commit with the fixed version of the code (if you like, this
    commit can also contain the files mentioned above)

**Each part must be committed by its deadline.**

## Concluding Remarks

Despite the fixes you've made, there are almost certainly still many
bugs lurking in the program. Although it is possible to get to a secure
program by repeatedly finding and fixing bugs (at least when the program
is this small), it's a lot of work, and just because a fuzzer stops
finding bugs doesn't mean that the program is bug-free!

Realistically, this program is probably not salvageable in its current
state. It would be better in this case to rewrite it from scratch,
either in C using a very defensive programming style, or in a safer
language like Python or Rust. In the "clean" directory, you can find
a cleanly written version of the program (written in C) that
should be relatively bug-free [1]. You'll notice that it's a lot more
verbose, and checks for many more errors than the buggy
version---writing safe C code is difficult!

[1] Although you are encouraged to try to prove us wrong by finding bugs
    in it!
